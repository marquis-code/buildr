Designed with sustainability at its core, Grabhub addresses one of the world’s pressing issues—food waste—by transforming surplus goods into valuable resources. </p></section><section class="lg:py-12 text-xl py-6 lg:px-44"><h2 class="lg:text-2xl text-xl font-semibold mb-6 text-[#222222]">The Challenge</h2><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-[#222222]"> Grabhub, an Ontario-based company, was determined to combat the significant issue of food waste while also addressing the financial strain it places on both retailers and consumers. Retailers often found themselves with surplus food items and home essentials nearing their best-by dates, leading to considerable losses and contributing to environmental degradation through increased landfill waste.  </p><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-[#222222]">On the other side, consumers were seeking affordable options for quality groceries and essentials but lacked access to discounted products that were still perfectly usable. Grabhub needed a solution that could bridge this gap, ensuring that excess inventory was efficiently moved while providing cost-effective options for shoppers.</p></section><section class="lg:py-12 text-xl py-6 lg:px-44"><h2 class="lg:text-2xl text-xl font-semibold mb-6 text-[#222222]">Product Solution</h2><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-[#222222] mb-8"> Buildr’s team partnered with Grabhub to develop a comprehensive online marketplace tailored to reduce food waste and offer savings to consumers.
