They needed a user-friendly platform where tenants could quickly discover and secure co-living arrangements at affordable rates. However, building an all-in-one solution that catered to tenants, service providers, and agents—each with their own unique needs—posed a significant challenge. </p></section><section class="lg:py-12 text-xl py-6 lg:px-44"><h2 class="lg:text-2xl text-xl font-semibold mb-6 text-[#222222]">Product Solution</h2><p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-[#222222] mb-8"> Our team collaborated with BlackCountry to architect and launch a platform that streamlined the entire housing process. We developed individual apps for tenants, service providers, and agents, ensuring each stakeholder had the right tools to list, manage, and secure living spaces.
